# PBPK Model for Chlorinated Polyfluoroalkyl Ether Sulfonates (Cl-PFAES)

This repository contains the code and documentation for the manuscript:

**"Development of Physiologically Based Toxicokinetic Models for Chlorinated Polyfluoroalkyl Ether Sulfonates and the Extrapolation on Health Risk Assessment in Chinese Population"**

## Overview

This project provides a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model for several chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates (Cl-PFAES), designed to support internal dose estimation and health risk assessment in human populations. The models were calibrated and validated using available experimental and biomonitoring data and are capable of extrapolation to other PFAS chemicals.
